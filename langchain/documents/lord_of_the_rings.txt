The Lord of the Rings

Chapter 1: A Long-expected Party

When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.

Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure.

And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; but unchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.

Chapter 2: The Shadow of the Past

Gandalf the Grey was the greatest of the Istari, the wizards who came to Middle-earth to aid in the struggle against Sauron. He was known by many names: Gandalf the Grey, Gandalf the White, Mithrandir to the Elves, Tharkûn to the Dwarves, and Incánus in the South.

It was Gandalf who discovered that Bilbo's ring was the One Ring of Sauron, the Dark Lord. For many years he had suspected the truth, but it was not until he found the scroll of Isildur in the archives of Minas Tirith that he knew for certain.

Gandalf first met Frodo Baggins when the young hobbit was just a child. He would often visit Bag End to see his old friend Bilbo, and would tell stories to the young Frodo about the wide world beyond the Shire. These stories filled Frodo's heart with wonder and a desire for adventure.

When Bilbo left the Shire on his eleventy-first birthday, he left the Ring to Frodo, making him the Ring-bearer. Gandalf instructed Frodo to keep the Ring safe and secret, and to use it only in the most dire circumstances.

Chapter 3: Three is Company

Frodo Baggins, now the Ring-bearer, lived quietly in Bag End for seventeen years after Bilbo's departure. He was well-liked by his neighbors, though some found him queer and took to calling him "Mad Baggins" behind his back.

Samwise Gamgee, Frodo's gardener and closest friend, was the son of Hamfast Gamgee, who had been Bilbo's gardener before him. Sam was a simple hobbit with a great heart, and his loyalty to Frodo would prove to be one of the most important factors in the quest to destroy the Ring.

When Gandalf finally returned to the Shire after many years of absence, he brought grave news. The Dark Lord Sauron had risen again in Mordor, and his servants, the Nazgûl, were searching for the Ring. Frodo would have to leave the Shire and take the Ring to Rivendell, the house of Elrond.

Chapter 4: A Short Cut to Mushrooms

Frodo, Sam, and their friends Pippin and Merry set out from the Shire, taking a shortcut through Farmer Maggot's fields. This led to a chase by the farmer's dogs, but they managed to escape and continued on their journey.

They met a group of Elves led by Gildor Inglorion, who gave them food and shelter for the night. The Elves sang songs of the Elder Days and spoke of the great deeds of heroes long past. This encounter gave the hobbits hope and courage for the difficult journey ahead.

Chapter 5: A Conspiracy Unmasked

Frodo discovered that his friends had known about his plans to leave the Shire for some time. They had been preparing for the journey and had gathered supplies and ponies. This conspiracy of friendship would prove invaluable in the days to come.

The four hobbits set out together, determined to reach Rivendell and deliver the Ring to the wise Elrond. They knew that the road would be dangerous, but they were prepared to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

The Fellowship of the Ring

The Ring-bearer, Frodo Baggins, carried the One Ring of Sauron, the most powerful and dangerous object in Middle-earth. The Ring had the power to corrupt all who possessed it, and only the pure of heart could resist its influence for long.

Gandalf the Grey was the greatest of the wizards, sent to Middle-earth to aid in the struggle against the Dark Lord. He was wise and powerful, but also kind and gentle with those he cared for.

Samwise Gamgee was Frodo's loyal companion and friend. His simple courage and unwavering loyalty would prove to be the Ring-bearer's greatest strength in the darkest hours of the quest.

The Ring had been forged by Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom, and only there could it be destroyed. The journey to Mordor would be long and perilous, but it was the only way to save Middle-earth from the Dark Lord's tyranny.
